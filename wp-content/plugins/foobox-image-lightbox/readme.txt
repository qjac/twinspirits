A responsive image lightbox for WordPress galleries & Foo Gallery

== Description ==

FooBox was the first lightbox to take responsive layout seriously. Not only does it scale images to look better on phones, but it rearranges it's button controls to look great in both portrait or landscape orientation.

Works with most image gallery plugins, but works best with our free [FooGallery](http://wordpress.org/plugins/foogallery/) plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My theme has a built-in lightbox and it shows under FooBox. What can I do? =

There is a setting to try and disable hard coded lightboxes, but this is not a sure-fire solution for every scenario. If that setting does not work for you, you might need to deregister certain javascript files, or uncomment certain lines of code in your theme to remove it's lightbox.
